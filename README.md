# Project Euler Solutions

Recently, I discovered my solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about).
Some of them are coded in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/),
some in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)),
and some of them in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

Here they are.
